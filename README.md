# Optimizing-Predictive-Models-for-Sales-Forecasting-A-Comparative-Analysis

This project focuses on optimizing predictive models for sales forecasting through a comparative analysis. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts sales while avoiding overfitting to the training data. Various regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression, are employed and evaluated based on their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) scores. Feature engineering techniques, such as encoding date features as cyclic variables and one-hot encoding categorical variables, are applied to preprocess the data. The Random Forest Regression model is ultimately selected for its balance between accuracy and generalization. The project concludes with forecasting sales for a specific time period using the selected model.

## Conclusion

This project aimed to optimize predictive models for sales forecasting by analyzing a provided dataset through various stages, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. EDA revealed insights into the dataset's characteristics, while feature engineering techniques were employed to extract relevant information and enhance model predictive power. Preprocessing steps ensured data readiness for modeling, including handling outliers, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Subsequently, several regression models were trained and evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE), with the Random Forest Regression model emerging as the top performer. Leveraging this model, sales forecasts were generated for future periods, demonstrating its practical applicability. Overall, this project underscores the significance of thorough data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection in optimizing sales forecasting models, offering valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
